# Mandelbrot-Set
Draws the Mandelbrot Set using OpenGL and C

The Mandelbrot set is one of the first fractals to be drawn using Computer Graphics and has fascinated people ever since.

It uses complex number and the two simple operations of addition and multiplication alone to draw the fabulous curve.
It is in this beauty and simplicity that the urge to recreate this fractal never dies out. 

OpenGL can be installed using the following command: sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev

Compilation of the file must be done as: gcc -o foo foo.c -lglut -lGLU -lGL
